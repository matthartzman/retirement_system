"""Ensure the project root is importable as `src` regardless of how pytest is
invoked. Most test modules do `from src.xxx import yyy` with no sys.path setup
of their own, relying on `python -m pytest` adding the current working
directory to sys.path automatically. CI (and any bare `pytest` invocation)
does not get that for free, so this must run before test collection imports
any test module.
